As fungi seek sustenance, they transform their environment and <b>help or hurt</b> the organisms around them. Using mathematics and experiments, I work to understand how these microscopic interactions affect the <b>entire Earth.</b>

In 2016, I graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Biology. At Stanford, I completed an Computer Science honors thesis, which integrated public data sets to investigate the evolution of ectomycorrhizal mutualism. After graduating, I worked on <b>ectomycorrhizal fungi</b> as lab manager for <a href="https://mykophile.com/">Kabir Peay's group</a> (Stanford), studied <b>fungal pathogens</b> in <a href="https://www.mordecailab.com">Erin Mordecai's lab</a> (Stanford) and <b>mathematically model</b> the role of fungi in ecosystems in collaboration with <a href="https://case.edu/artsci/biol/abbottlab/Who.html">Karen Abbot's group</a> (CWRU).

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href=\"http://crowtherlab.com/\">Crowther Lab</a> at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

Natural history is a lifelong passion of mine; in my free time I am often outside, failing to understand the natural world around me. I am an enthusiastic amateur botanist and mycologist, and enjoy contributing to citizen science projects including <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/people/joewan">iNaturalist</a> and <a href="http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/show_user/9864">MushroomObserver</a>.
