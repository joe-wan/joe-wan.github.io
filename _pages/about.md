As living things seek sustenance, they transform their environment and <b>help or hurt</b> the organisms around them. Using mathematics and experiments, I work to understand the importance of these species interactions from <b>the smallest to the largest</b> scales of biological complexity.

In 2016, I graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Biology. At Stanford, I completed an Computer Science honors thesis, which integrated public data sets to investigate the evolution of ectomycorrhizal mutualism. After graduating, I worked on <b>ectomycorrhizal fungi</b> as lab manager for <a href="https://mykophile.com/">Kabir Peay's group</a> (Stanford), studied <b>fungal pathogens</b> in <a href="https://www.mordecailab.com">Erin Mordecai's lab</a> (Stanford) and <b>mathematically modeled</b> the role of fungi in ecosystems in collaboration with <a href="https://case.edu/artsci/biol/abbottlab/Who.html">Karen Abbot's group</a> (CWRU).

I completed my doctoral degree at the Department of Environmental Systems Sciences (D-USYS) at ETH ZÃ¼rich in 2023, focusing on applying theories of coexistence from community ecology to questions at the ecosystem scale and beyond (<a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/625466">"Uniting community and ecosystem ecology to understand the global carbon cycle"</a>). Currently I am a post-doctoral scholar at the Institute of Integrative Biology at National Taiwan University, working with <a href="https://pojuke.com/">Po-Ju Ke</a>.

Natural history is a lifelong passion of mine; in my free time I am often outside, failing to understand the natural world around me. I am an enthusiastic amateur botanist and mycologist, and enjoy contributing to citizen science projects including <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/people/joewan">iNaturalist</a> and <a href="http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/show_user/9864">MushroomObserver</a>.
