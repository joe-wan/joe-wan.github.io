Currently, I am a technician and lab manager in <a href="http://www.mykophile.com/">Kabir Peay's lab</a> in Stanford University's Department of Biology. My work focuses on applying computational tools and high-throughput sequencing technologies to understand the consequences of plantâ€“fungal mutualism for plant community succession and fungal biogeography.

In 2016, I graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Biology. At Stanford, I completed an Computer Science honors thesis, which integrated public data sets to investigate the evolution of ectomycorrhizal mutualism.

I am committed to addressing educational disparity. As a Classroom Director for <a href="http://www.dreamcatchersyouth.org/">DreamCatchers</a>, a Palo Alto non-profit organization, I work with low-income, historically underrepresented middle school students in the Palo Alto Unified School District.

Natural history is a lifelong passion of mine; in my free time I am often outside, failing to understand the natural world around me. I am an enthusiastic amateur botanist and mycologist, and enjoy contributing to citizen science projects including <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/people/joewan">iNaturalist</a> and <a href="http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/show_user/9864">MushroomObserver</a>.
