    message: "As living things seek sustenance, they transform their environment and <b>help or hurt</b> the organisms around them. Using mathematics and experiments, I work to understand the importance of these species interactions from <b>the smallest to the largest</b> scales of biological complexity.<br /><br />
    I am a community ecologist and theoretical biologist, currently a postdoctoral scholar in the <a href=\"https://pojuke.com/\">Ke Lab</a> at National Taiwan University."
