This is my first blog post! More content will appear once I get around to it.

Let's see if LaTeX works. Here's a useful equation from Chesson 2000:

\\[ \frac{1}{N_i} \cdot \frac{dN_i}{dt} = r_i ( 1 - a_{ii}N_i - a_{ij}N_j ) \\]

In this equation, \\( N_i \\) is the density of species \\( i \\). The code for this
equation is:

    \\[ \frac{1}{N_i} \cdot \frac{dN_i}{dt} = r_i ( 1 - a_{ii}N_i - a_{ij}N_j ) \\]
